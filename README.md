Alexa Skills - Telling Time

With this Skill, you can practice telling time and doing calculations with time.

This Skill has currently three modes: learn mode, identify mode, and math mode.

The identify mode requires an Echo Show or Echo Spot in order to view images. The learn and the math mode can be accessed with any device.

Recommended to use the Alexa app on your mobile device to view contents better.
